# Yelp Recommendations Using Machine Learning

Imagine that a Yelp user has just finished a glowing review for a Thai restaurant in San Francisco. As they submit their review, they are wondering if there are any other Thai restaurants in the area that are just as good or even better than the restaurant they just review. Our goal in this model is to help recommend 5 different restaurants for this user based on their review of the initial restaurant and other restaurant information.

This module takes reviews for San Francisco restaurants and creates a model that recommends the top 5 restaurants for that reviewer based on the restaurant's food category, star rating, and review sentiment. The models used in this project include Word2Vec, Word Mover's Distance, and TextBlob sentiment analysis. The data was obtained through the Yelp API Business Endpoint.
